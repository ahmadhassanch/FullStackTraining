- We want to do IO operations which do not block each other, we need to run functions asynchronously
- Solution: async, await

PART I: 
=================

	- Co-routines are implemented as generators
	- Generators are used for iteration
	- async def func(): 
		   	print("hello")

			a = func()        .... returns a co-routine

	- a.send(None), prints "hello" BUT raises exception because 

	- Event loop drives co-routines WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS
		loop = asyncio.get_event_loop();
		loop.run_until_complete(a)

		.. "hello", without exception
